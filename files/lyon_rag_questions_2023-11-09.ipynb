We\\'ll start by importing pandas as pd and numpy as np like we normally do so that we\\'re prepared to use those libraries going forward. So let\\'s take a step back and try to understand what the index is as we\\'ve told you before and as we\\'ve become a little familiar with every series and data frame has an index. And we have been referring to those as the row labels for the data we didn\\'t lie this is still true, but the index in pandas is a lot more powerful and meaningful and just labeling the rows. And the purpose of our lecture today will be to help us understand these other properties and behaviors of the index for a series or data frame. So the pandas documentation reads that data alignment is intrinsic the link between labels and data will not be broken on this dense so explicitly by you. And so in the other words this means that the index and the column names are going to be used to make sure that the data is always properly aligned whenever you\\'re operating on multiple data frames.\", metadata={\\'source\\': \\'videos/transcripts_tiny/2.2.1 the pandas index.srt\\', \\'chunk_number\\': 1, \\'timestamps\\': \\'00:01:12 --> 00:02:37\\'}), Document(page_content=\"Forgot a comma right here and here we go we get all five variables and we only have these three years but we have them for all four countries. And there\\'s a nice symmetry between how we can use these indexing rules for a multi-level column or multi-level row data frame. So we\\'ve talked about how to set the index but one of the other key operations when we\\'re dealing with the index is to reset it. And when we call the reset index method when we and we don\\'t pass any arguments the following happens we will see that the columns that were previously used for the index are returned back to be columns alongside the existing ones. And the index is going to be reset to go from zero one to all the way through the total number of rows and the data frame minus one. This is the default index also called a range index in pandas and when we call reset index again whatever we had there is move back as a column and then we get back the default range index. So there are a few variations of behavior with the reset index method and we\\'d like for you to do this exercise now to learn what these variations are from the documentation of the method.\", metadata={\\'source\\': \\'videos/transcripts_tiny/2.2.1 the pandas index.srt\\', \\'chunk_number\\': 45, \\'timestamps\\': \\'00:58:14 --> 00:59:47\\'}), Document(page_content=\"And the next natural step would be okay well what if we need to align based on certain properties or columns of the data. For example, maybe we would want to be able to align our entries based on the year. If we wanted to set the year is the index we would call the set index method on our data frame and we can pass it year either as a string or as the only item in a list. And now is that pandas has gotten rid of the 01234 labels on the left. And now the row labels are actually coming from the year column. We can also notice that the printed output looks slightly different than it used to. Before the year column was right up a little bit higher next to all these other column labels. Now it\\'s down and a little bit to the left and it may be a little subtle to see on my computer, but if you\\'re able to zoom in on yours, you\\'ll see that the year column now has both numbers indicating that these are labels.

We\\'ll learn how we can set the index to something different as well as reset it to get back where we started. We\\'ll take a closer look at how we can select subsets of the data by slicing and extracting values according to the index or row labels as well as the column labels. And finally we\\'ll point out that for a data frame the column names are also used to align data and this will become very clear shortly.
