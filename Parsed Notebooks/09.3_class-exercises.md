# In-class Exercises

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy as sa

from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
```

**Introduction**

We will continue to use the instacart data set we discussed in class.

We load the data below:

```python
# Create a SQL alchemy engine and add table information to the engine
eng = sa.create_engine("sqlite:///instacart.db")

Session = sa.orm.sessionmaker(bind=eng)
```

```python
def run_query(eng, query, str_length=30):
    with eng.connect() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(query)
        cols = result.keys()
        vals = result.fetchmany(5)

        fmter = ("{" + f":<{str_length}" + "}") * len(cols)
        print(fmter.format(*cols))
        for _vals in vals:
            _pvals = map(lambda x: str(x)[:str_length], _vals)
            print(fmter.format(*_pvals))
```

**Question 1**

Write SQL queries for the following questions:


_Question 1.1_: Which user had the most orders?

```python

```

_Question 1.2_: Which user had the smallest average time between orders?

```python

```

_Question 1.3_: Which department had the smallest number of items?

```python

```

_Question 1.4_: How many total orders happened on each day of the week? Which days were the most popular? Which days were the least popular? Did the answer surprise you?

```python

```

_Question 1.5_: How many total orders happened on each hour of the day? Which hours were the most popular? Which hours were the least popular? Did the answer surprise you?

```python

```

_Question 1.6_: What was the largest number of unique products ordered in a single order?

```python

```

_Question 1.7_: What was the least number of unique products ordered in a single order?


```python

```

**Question 2**

Ask your own questions :)

What can you learn from the data?
