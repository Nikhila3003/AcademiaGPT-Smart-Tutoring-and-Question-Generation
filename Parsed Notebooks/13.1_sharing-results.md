# Sharing results

## Intro

-   As a researchers and data analysts, we are knowledge workers
-   A knowledge worker is a worker whose main capital is knowledge
-   A primary responsibility of knowledge workers (especially those who
    work with data) is to use information to assist decision making
    processes
-   This includes both performing analysis and communicating results

### Communicating results

-   Being able to effectively communicate and share the output of our
    work is essential
-   Without effective communication our work will have minimal impact
-   To communicate effectively we need to decide:
    -   Audience
    -   Content
    -   Medium/technology

### Example: this class

-   We have made a decision to distribute the materials for this course
    as Jupyter notebooks
-   Why?
    -   Audience: fellow data workers
    -   Content: text, code, results
    -   Medium/technology: Jupyter notebook via cocalc

## Sharing Jupyter notebooks

-   There are many options for sharing Jupyter notebooks
-   We will cover a few of them here and offer a suggestion for audience
    and content that would make each decision suitable
-   We will also walk through an example of how to share a notebook with
    each technology

### Github

-   GitHub is a web service that provides remote git repositories and
    collaboration/sharing features
-   GitHub is home to millions of open source projects
-   When viewed from a web browser, files on GitHub are rendered nicely
-   This includes syntax highlighting for code, images, pdfs, and
    static+rendered Jupyter notebooks

1.  Why Share Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub

    There are two main reasons to share on GitHub

    1.  Collaborate with others:
        -   Audience: Colleagues, co-authors
        -   Content: Research code, documentation, examples, or
            experiments
    2.  Share publicly
        -   Audience: Public
        -   Content: reports, appendixes

2.  Example: Sharing on GitHub

    -   Let's do an example of sharing on GitHub
    -   We'll share the notebook `v01_statistics_2.ipynb`

### QuantEcon notes

-   [QuantEcon Notes](https://notes.quantecon.org/) is a free online
    service from QuantEcon
-   The purpose of Notes is to be a library of high-quality notebooks on
    topics related to economics
-   Notebooks on Notes can execute javascript, have embedded javascript
    plots (e.g. altair or plotly)
-   Other Notes users can give a thumbs up or down to a notebooks
-   Notes supports commenting on notebooks to facilitate discussion

1.  Why Share on QuantEcon Notes

    -   Audience: public, research community
    -   Content: Academic content with relation to computation or
        economics

2.  Example: Sharing on Notes

    -   Again, we'll share the contents of `v01_statistics_2.ipynb`,
        this time on QuantEcon Notes

### nbconvert

-   `nbconvert` is a tool from the jupyter team to convert/export
    notebooks to other files types
-   `nbconvert` is a `pip` installable python package that must be
    installed and run on your local computer
-   `nbconvert` can convert to many file types, like pdf, html,
    slideshows, latex, and more

1.  Why Share with `nbconvert`

    -   Audience: public or private – need static, single-file version
        of your work
    -   Content: books, reports, documents created in Jupyter

2.  Example: Sharing with `nbconvert`

    -   We'll now use `nbconvert` to share `v01_statistics_2.ipynb` as…

        -   A Python script
        -   An html page
        -   A pdf
        -   HTML slides

    -   In each case we'll use a command that looks like this:

        ``` bash
        jupyter nbconvert v01_statistics_2.ipynb --to XXX
        ```

        where `XXX` represents the format we would like to generate

## Interactive Sharing

-   As Python programmers, we have many options for sharing our analysis
-   Some of these options are static, like posting code or Jupyter
    notebooks to GitHub, QuantEcon Notes, or some other web service
-   Others are interactive, where the users interacting with our content
    have the opportunity to provide input, which will trigger our code
    to run and return new outputs

### Methods of Interactive Sharing

-   There are many options for interactive sharing of analysis:
    -   Publishing Python package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) (so it
        can be `pip` installable)
        -   Audience: other programmers
        -   Content: source ocde
    -   Web APIs: create a server that can listen for requests and
        return responses
        -   Audience: other programmers, data consumers
        -   Content: data or images produced by code
    -   Interactive applications: our code as a website for users to
        interact with
        -   Audience: consumers of our analysis
        -   Content: data or images produced by our code

### Voila

-   Voila is a python package for exposing a Jupyter notebook as a web
    service
-   Voila renders notebook content as a website `and` connects to a
    Python process for handling user input
-   Tightly integrated into Jupyter ecosystem, includes ability to use
    jupyter widgets from webpage

1.  Why Share with Viola?

    -   Audience: public, co-authors, colleagues
    -   Content: interactive Jupyter notebooks

2.  Example of Sharing with Viola

    -   Let's now turn `v01_statistics_2.ipynb` into an interactive web
        app using Voila

    -   To do this we'll use the following command:

        ``` bash
        voila v01_statistics_2.ipynb
        ```

### Streamlit

-   Streamlit is a Python library that translates Python scripts into
    interactive websites
-   Requires zero html, javascript, or css to create beautiful,
    interactive dashboards

1.  Why Share With Streamlit?

    -   Audience: public
    -   Content: interactive Python scripts

2.  Example of Sharing with Streamlit

    -   We'll turn some of the codes from `v01_statistics_2.ipynb` into
        a Python script and then create a Streamlit application

## Summary

-   Communication is essential for having an impact as a knowledge
    worker
-   Effective communication requires an understanding of audience and
    content, and the ability to choose the correct medium and technology
    for distribution
-   There are many static ways to share Jupyter notebooks: GitHub,
    QuantEcon notes, `nbconvert`
-   There are also many interactive ways to share our Python-based
    analysis: publish to PyPi, create an API, make an interactive
    application (voila/streamlit)
