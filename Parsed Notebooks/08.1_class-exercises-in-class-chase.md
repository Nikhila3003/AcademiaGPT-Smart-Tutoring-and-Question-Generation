# Timeseries: In class exercise

We will be using a version of the "Residential power usage 3years data - Timeseries" dataset from Kaggle (see https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinuti/residential-power-usage-3years-data-timeseries).

This dataset includes two data files:

1. `power_usage_2016_to_2020.csv`: This includes the data on the number of kWh of energy used on each day from 2016 to 2020. The value column is measured in [kWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour). The notes column can take values: `weekday`, `weekend`, `vacation`, `COVID_lockdown`.
2. `weather_2016_2020_daily.csv`: This includes various pieces of weather information for each relevant day

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Load power usage data

```python
power_usage = pd.read_csv("power_usage_2016_to_2020.csv")

# According to the documentation, datetimes are formatted
# incorrectly so they need to be reset
power_usage["dt"] = pd.date_range(
    "2016-06-01 00:00:00", freq="1H",
    periods=power_usage.shape[0]
)
power_usage = (
    power_usage.drop(
        columns=["day_of_week", "StartDate"]
    )
    .rename(
        columns={"Value (kWh)": "value"}
    )
)
```

```python
power_usage.tail()
```

Load weather data

```python
weather = pd.read_csv("weather_2016_2020_daily.csv")

# According to the documentation, datetimes are formatted
# incorrectly so they need to be reset
weather["date"] = pd.date_range(
    "2016-06-01", freq="1D", periods=weather.shape[0]
)

weather = weather.drop(columns=["Date", "Day"])
```

```python
weather.head()
```

```python
power_usage = power_usage.set_index("dt")
```

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
# fig, ax = plt.subplots()

weather_subset = weather.loc[:, ["date", "Temp_max"]]
power_subset = power_usage.drop(["notes"], axis=1).resample("d").sum()

```

```python
power_subset.join(weather_subset.set_index("date")).plot()
```

**Questions**

Feel free to explore the data on your own, but these are some hints for directions that we think could be interesting.

What week had the biggest difference between the largest and smallest hourly energy expenditure?

```python
(
    power_usage
    .resample("W-Thu")
    ["value"]
    .agg(["min", "max"])
    .rename(columns={"min": "minn", "max": "maxx"})
    .eval("maxx - minn")
    .idxmax()
)
```

Plot daily energy usage vs daily temperature

```python

```

What month had the highest total energy expenditure?

```python
power_usage.drop(["notes"], axis=1).resample("m").sum().idxmax()
```

```python
weather.query("date == '2016-08-31'")
```

What month had the highest average energy expenditure over all of the years?

```python
power_usage.drop(["notes"], axis=1).resample("m").mean().idxmax()
```

What months have the most rain where the data is collected?

```python
weather.dtypes
```

```python
weather["moy"] = weather["date"].dt.month
```

```python
weather.groupby("moy")["Precipit"].mean()
```

What months have the most wind?

```python

```

Compute the rolling 24 hour average of energy expenditure.

How might you measure whether certain observations are an anomaly? According to your measure, are there anomalies? Do these anomalies correspond to something happening in the weather?

```python

```

```python

```

```python

```

Compute the rolling 7 day average of energy expenditure.

How might you measure whether certain hourly observations are an anomaly? According to your measure, are there anomalies? Do these anomalies correspond to something happening in the weather?

```python
power_df = power_usage.resample("d")["value"].sum()
```

```python
power_df.rolling(window="7d", min_periods=7).mean().plot()
```

```python
power_df.plot()
```

```python
import numpy as np
```

```python
foo = 100 * np.abs(power_df - power_df.rolling(window="7d", min_periods=7).mean()) / power_df.rolling(window="7d", min_periods=7).mean()
```

```python
foo.describe()
```

```python

```

```python
foo.loc["2016-07-15":"2016-07-24"]
```

```python
power_usage.resample("d").agg({"value": "sum", "notes": "first"}).loc["2016-07-15":"2016-07-22"]
```

```python
power_df.loc["2016-07-15":"2016-07-24"]
```

```python
weather.set_index("date").loc["2016-07-15":"2016-07-24"]
```
