1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's now talk about labor statistics.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,160
By labor statistics, what we mean is the data that's used to measure and quantify the

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
health of labor markets.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,480
So in the United States, one of the main sources for labor statistics is a survey known

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,320
as the current population survey.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,800
And the survey has been in one version or another, been administered since the late 1930s.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,800
But it collects data on kind of demographic and economic characteristics of individuals

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
and households.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
The data it collected is administered.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,800
So the survey is administered to roughly 60,000 households per month.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,560
And rather miraculously they achieve an average response rate of nearly 90%.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,000
Because there's about 60,000 households per month.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,920
This means that they have a relatively good sample for geography such as state and metropolitan

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,640
statistical area.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:10,920
But maybe this data isn't particularly accurate for geographic level like counties.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,320
So one of the strengths of the CPS is its inherent panel nature.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Let's talk about why that's helpful.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:33,000
So if we have kind of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November,

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
December.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,840
So here's the 12 months of the year.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,280
So in the CPS, once you're selected, you're interviewed for four consecutive months.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,360
And then you're interviewed for four consecutive months, again, eight months later.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
So let's work through an example.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,080
So imagine this is the year 2020.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,320
And you begin being interviewed by the CPS in February.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,040
Then you're interviewed in February, March, April, and May of 2020.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,800
And then you wait eight months.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,880
So not interviewed in June, not interviewed in July.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,080
August, September, October, November, December.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,880
And then we come into 2021 January.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,160
So you've been out of the sample for eight months now.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,640
And you begin being interviewed again in February, 2021, 2021.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,680
So then you're interviewed again, February, March, April, and May.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,920
So one of the strengths is that this results in you being interviewed during the same

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,800
set of months in two different years.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,400
And additionally, because of this, you can track someone for consecutive months.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
So you could see whether someone in March had lost a job that they currently, that they had

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,160
had in February or how their income might have changed, et cetera.

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,000
So this panel nature makes the CPS really helpful for asking lots of different labor market

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,960
questions.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,840
So what types of things are asked?

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,600
The CPS collects information on demographics and labor status mostly.

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,480
So they'll ask you things like, how many people live in the household?

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,960
What are the sex age and race of these different people?

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,800
And what's the relationship between each set of people?

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,960
So this tells you things like our grandparents living in the house with their children

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,920
and their grandchildren.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,920
It tells you whether other people in the house are deep in the head of the household

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,320
or whether they're children, et cetera.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,880
It also collects information on whether you're working, whether you're working full-time

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
or part-time.

52
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,240
It gets an estimate of your hourly pay and how many hours you work.

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,600
They ask about whether you're looking for work, how you're looking for work, whether you're

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,880
retired, or whether you have any other disabilities.

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,280
And they ask lots of other things.

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,240
You can actually find their exact questionnaires online at the link in this notebook.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
So who uses the CPS?

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Well, the truth is, lots of people do.

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,360
The one we're going to be talking about mostly today is the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,920
And they issue a jobs report once a month based on the numbers collected by the current

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,920
population survey.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,040
Additionally, because this data is open, researchers, anyone can access the micro data

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
behind the CPS, so you could collect these surveys and track these people on your own.

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,240
And actually, additionally, there's lots of private companies that use this information

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,440
for their own decision making.

66
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,400
Okay, so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about some of the

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,800
common terms used in labor statistics.

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,360
So employed means an individual who did any work at all as a paid employee, whether

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,760
if they worked in their own business, worked on their own farm, or if they worked 15 or

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,800
more hours as unpaid workers in a family member's business.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,120
And then part time is an individual who usually works less than 35 hours per week.

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,880
A full time individual is someone who usually works 35 or more hours per week.

73
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,360
And both of these definitions are defined across all jobs.

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,040
So if someone had what they considered two part time jobs, they were 20 hours a week each,

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,560
they would be considered a full time worker.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,720
Unemployed means an individual who is not employed and was available to work and made an

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,120
active effort to find employment during the four week period, ending with the survey

78
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,920
reference week.

79
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,000
The labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed individuals.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,720
The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labor

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
force.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,520
And those not in the labor force are individuals aged 16 and older who were neither employed

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,880
nor unemployed.

84
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,920
And you can find more detail about each of these definitions in the BLS documentation.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,040
So the last thing we're going to talk about are kind of definitionally that is going

86
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,160
to be things will call the transition rates.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,000
And so these are key statistics that people use to analyze how the labor economy is

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,360
churning for lack of a better word.

89
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,680
So there's four different rates that we'll talk about.

90
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,280
There's the E to E rate, which is the fraction of people who are employed during the

91
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,600
current month and in the last month, E to E are the people who are the people who

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:54,240
are the people who transition from employed to unemployed, the E which is the people who

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,640
transition from the unemployed to the employed and the E to E which is the fraction

94
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,680
of people who are unemployed and continue to be unemployed.

95
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,100
And if we hold the labor force constant, what we get is that E E plus E U plus U E plus

96
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,500
U is equal to one.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,900
And you can add additional states.

98
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,180
So for example, we could have an E N rate, which would be the number of people who fraction

99
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,020
of people who are employed previously and transitioned into not in the labor force.

100
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,380
There's something like that, but we're just going to focus on these four.

101
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:37,700
And I think this raises a natural question in kind of there's two ways to increase unemployment.

102
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,980
You could either see a decrease in what we'll call kind of the job finding rate, which

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,940
is the transition rate from unemployed to employed, or an increase in the firing rate,

104
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,660
and in the separation rate, I guess we'll call it, which is an increase in the rate of

105
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,380
employed to unemployed.

106
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,740
And so kind of in the back of your mind as we work through today's lecture and next week's

107
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,100
lecture, we want you to be thinking about which of these channels will have a larger effect

108
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,500
on unemployment levels.

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,540
And we'll ask you to do this formally next class.

110
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,860
So the question we're going to ask today with the data that we download is going to be

111
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,180
how changes in the transition rates changed between changed during two periods of economic

112
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,700
turbulence in the United States.

113
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,700
So we're going to analyze the great recession and the current pandemic to explore how these

114
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
different rates changed.

115
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,740
In particular, we saw large increases unemployment in unemployment, and we're going to

116
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,020
see what happened to the U.E. and the U.E. rates during these two times of economic turbulence.

117
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,460
So we'll do that at the end of class.
