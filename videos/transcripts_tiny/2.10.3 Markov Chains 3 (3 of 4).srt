1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so we want to compute the average duration of employment.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, that's going to be easy.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If we do basically a version of the same calculation that we did before,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we're going to find the average duration of staying employed is now one over beta.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's exactly the same that we did before, except in this case p is going to be beta.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So in our in our in our in our lake model, we have that one over alpha is the average

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
average duration of unemployment.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And one over beta is the average duration of employment.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we got that from the from just the parameters that define the transition model.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just mentioned another example, which is a classic example of a mark off chain.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So quite a famous paper by James Hamilton for using US unemployment data.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So he was looking at unemployment data too.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He estimated a stochastic matrix.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now you know what that is from our definition.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So he estimated this econometrically.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Later on we'll talk about how you might go around estimating this.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So he estimated with monthly data and he had three states.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He had what he called a normal growth state.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A mild recession and a severe recession.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He estimated this some time ago.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Before he actually had data on what we in the United States now regard as severe recessions.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So you know what the these transition probabilities are interesting because they tell you like.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well when when you're in normal growth we can just read this.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When you're normal growth they usually just stay in the most likely thing is you'll stay in normal growth.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But with the small probability you'll go into like we growth.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So you know if you're in we growth.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So you'll you'll stay there for an experience.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You might go back to normal growth but there's a very small probability that you'll go to a very bad growth state.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Big recession.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And if you have the unfortunate to get to a bad growth state you're never going back from there to.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To high growth right away.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You might you might transit to a.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well if you're not I'm reading it wrong.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you're if you're in a very bad growth state.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You you might recover to a slightly less bad growth state but you won't go all the way back you won't go back here.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So these things that I was just struggling to explain.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
People write down what's called a directed graph.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And a directed graph has a consists of nodes.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And edges.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's a very nice way to describe a mark off chain.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you wake a pdf you'll find that.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So let's see what it looks like.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So this is a typical directed graph to to show Hamilton's.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is Hamilton's.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Model for mark off model for unemployment.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So this is normal growth.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So what this arrow means is with probably.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
With this arrow means is you'll you'll just stay next period one the arrows are one step transition probability transitions.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And the labels are the probabilities so you'll stay here.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You might go here.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You notice there's no there's no arrow like this.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That would be a different mark off chain.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's nowhere like this if you want to get.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you want to get to three to step third state.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're going to have to go through the intermediate state and so on.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So just moving ahead.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So you know just summarize what a mark off chain is going to be a.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's going to be a pair.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's going to be a stochastic matrix.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And an initial.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A marginal distribution over.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The time zero state.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's the marginal distribution over the time zero state.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So here's this is kind of a key.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is going to be a key sentence.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So one way to study questions about mark off chains is just a simulator.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And big parts of statistics actually do this.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They take mark off chains and they simulate them to learn things.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Actually about the chain.

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We're going to spend some time talking about this bullet point.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's a lot in here to approximate the probability of an event e.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What you can do is you can run a simulation many times.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then you count fractions.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay. So do you remember we spent some time talking about what this probability mean.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So what a frequent is thinks that what probability means is the.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Fraction.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That can be anticipated in a very large sample.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And that's being exploited right here.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Here's some advertisement.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There's.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We if you go to.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Quanty.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We've written python programs that.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That make it very easy for you to study and simulate mark off chains.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So what we're going to what this.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So the quantity.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Content did to work for you there.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But it's actually mark off chains are so.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Fun and interesting to get your hands on it.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What this lecture does is it backs up and actually.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
From scratch using numpy.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's going to.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's going to generate some.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's going to show you how to simulate a mark off chain.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So let's spend a little time talking about that.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then in your time.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is a great way to learn python and build your confidence is.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do this to.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And do some examples.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So here's how to make your own.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The first thing we need.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The first thing we need is.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We have to have a mark off chain.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What we call what I called.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Pys zero here we're going to call this.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Going to change no.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Going to call this.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Whatever that word is.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So a mark off chain is going to be a p.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So that's the time zero probability.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's the time zero marginal.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And that's the transition matrix.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So if you give me.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Those two you define a mark off chain.

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then here's how one simulate.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Here's what I want.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Simulates.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Using random numbers at time t zero.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We're going to draw.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A random state.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
From the marginal distribution at time zero.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then every subsequent time period.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We're going to draw.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The new state.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
From the transition probability matrix.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So this is the initial.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And this is transitions.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And that's how we're going to use it.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So.

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You know, to make to make this go, we need one more thing.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We need a p a psi.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And we need a random number generator.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And we're going to use.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We're going to use a.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Something from quantity.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So this.

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So this.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So code is actually describing how that's done.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And example would be.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Here's here's here's the language.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Here's the language.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Here's the language.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This.

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think it's really good to slowly read Python code.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's good for your character.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's good for mind.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's a line that says that generates a.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A distribution that I want.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So we talked about this earlier.

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Like if I give you a probability distribution.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How can you generate a random draw from it?

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, this is how quantity comes going to do it.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I start with a probability distribution psi right here.

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And then that's what I want.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want a cumulative distribution function.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So what.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm now going to just that's just a.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A numpy command.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm going to compute the cumulative distribution.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And then what quantity kind of do is.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Quant quantity kind of random dot draw CDF of.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm going to draw from this CDF random draw and it tells me give me five numbers.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And my five numbers is going to give me well there.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I drew a.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Success success success failure.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I drew.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay, so that's we're going to use that.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So we have our three things.

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We have a p.

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We have a psi and we have a random number generator.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And now we're all dressed up and ready to go.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So we're going to.

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This quantity kind code in this little thing.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We're going to write us to casting matrix p.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We're going to need an initial state.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And we're going to take a sample size.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What I want you to do is.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Study this on your own because now we're.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Quote in quote rolling our own.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We're writing.

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Python function.

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's going to.

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's going to generate a.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A sample path.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Of length.

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, you're going to make this up.

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because there's these key word arguments.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're going to make this up.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We're going to input a p and we're going to input a.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
An initial condition.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
An initial distribution.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then we're going to do a.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
As.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A sample size.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So here we go.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So.

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So here's our we here's how this works.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just just an example would take this mark off chain.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Um.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Here's a claim.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's what does probability mean again.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're cycling back to that idea.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And this this is a claim.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A reminder and a claim that this is going to be verified.

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Um.

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So.

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, we're going to verify very soon.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's the claim.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What does probability mean?

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's a classic question.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Um.

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to use this code.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Create.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So X is going to be.

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We're going to generate how many a hundred thousand.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You should try that on your machine.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's our mark off chain.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We're going to try with from this initial distribution.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And.

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And.

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And we're going to generate a very long chain.

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And then the claim here in this lectures that.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The sample the sample mean is going to be.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The sample a mean for this for a very long sample is going to be around .25.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And notice when we.

239
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Um.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We generated this and then we used numpy.

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Um.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
To.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
To actually to actually compute the.

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I mean and it it turns out to be very close to .25.

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let me make a claim.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's going to make us somewhat clear.

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Serious claim before I kind of pause this.

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What we're talking about.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I claim.

251
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That if you compute.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The.

253
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Left.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Vectors.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Of this matrix that matrix left I can vector.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Associated I'll put a I'm going to take the left I can vector of that matrix associated.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
With.

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The unit.

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can value.

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm so I'm claiming that this matrix.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
As a unit I can value.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You could do this in exercise if you take the left I can vector of that.

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And you normalize it.

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Then.

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You.

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Will compute.

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm going to say something called.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The.

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The.

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The.

276
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The.

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The.

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The.

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The.

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The.

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The.

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The.

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The.

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The.

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The.

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The.

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The.

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The.

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The.

294
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The.

295
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The.

297
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The.

298
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The.
