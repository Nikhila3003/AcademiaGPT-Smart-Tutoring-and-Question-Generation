Values are organized in two\nways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable\ncontains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like\nheight, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all\nvalues measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race)\nacross attributes. – [Tidy Data (Journal of Statistical Software 2013)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)  \nWith this framing,  \n> A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are\nmatched with observations, variables, and types. In tidy data:\n1.  Each variable forms a column.\n2.  Each observation forms a row.\n3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table.  \nThe “column” and “row” terms map directly to pandas columns and rows, while the\n“table” maps to a pandas DataFrame.  \nThe question that should come to mind anytime you\'re introduced to a dataset is, "What uniquely identifies an “observation” in your data?"  \nIs it a country? A year? A combination of country and year?  \nThese will become the indices of your DataFrame.  \nThe concept of an "observation" may  not be unique to a dataset. For example, consider a time-series of county level GDP data.  \n* The most "pure" form of tidy data would probably classify the year/country as the identifier and have a single variable of GDP\n* You could also consider the year to be the unique identifier and have each country\'s GDP be the variable\n* Or, a variable might even be the GDP in a given year with the countries being the unique identifiers  \nWhat you consider to be an observation will depend on the question you\'re asking.' metadata={'Header 1': 'Reshape', 'Header 2': 'Tidy Data'}page_content='The data you receive is not always in a “shape” that makes it easy to analyze.  \nWhat do we mean by shape?

In our example, this moved `Team` down from\ncolumns to the index.\n- When we do pass a level, that level of column labels is moved down to the\nright-most level of the index and all other column labels stay in their\nrelative position.  \nNote that we can also move multiple levels at a time in one call to `stack`.  \n```python\nbball_wide.stack(level=["Player", "Team"])\n```  \nIn the example above, we started with one level on the index (just the year) and\nstacked two levels to end up with a three-level index.  \nNotice that the two new index levels went closer to the data than the existing\nlevel and that their order matched the order we passed in our list argument to\n`level`.' metadata={'Header 1': "Again, don't worry about this command...
