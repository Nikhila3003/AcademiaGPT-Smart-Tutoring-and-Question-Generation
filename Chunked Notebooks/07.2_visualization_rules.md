Psychology researchers have observed [*picture superiority*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_superiority_effect): the fact that images are more likely to be remembered than\nwords. While the reasons and extent of the effect are debated, the consensus view is that the effect exists.\nHow large might this effect be? In a paper by Defeyter, Russo, and McPartlin (2009), the authors found that participants were able to identify pictures they had previously studied for approximately 500 ms each with 75-85% accuracy but words with only a 55-65% accuracy.  \n1. Data visualizations help people walk through the logic you used to build the chart,\nallowing them to reason through the argument and thus makes your claim more convincing.  \nIn this lecture, we will discuss the process of creating a data visualization, ways to best ensure\nsuccessfully communication, and some general design guidelines.  \nAlong the way, you will be introduced to many features of `matplotlib` that were not discussed in the\nintroductory lecture.  \nWe won’t discuss most of these features, but we encourage you to read more in the\n[online documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) if you have questions.' metadata={'Header 1': 'activate plot theme', 'Header 2': 'Introduction'}page_content='Before we begin discussions of specific recommendations, it is helpful to agree on\nthe goal of a data visualization and a process that can be used to accomplish the goal.  \nAs mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of a visualization is to facilitate the communication\nof a message or idea.  \nWe have found the following steps to be useful for achieving this goal:  \n1. Identify the message.\n1. Describe your visualization.\n1. Create a draft of the visualization (and verify your data!).\n1. Fine tune the visualization details.  \nAfter discussing the role research plays in data visualization, we will use an example to provide\ndeeper context for the remaining steps.  \n**Step 0: Research**  \nBefore we proceed, note that prior to reaching this process, you will have spent\na significant amount of time exploring the data and thinking about your overall message.  \nIn fact, during the research step, you will almost certainly produce visualizations to help yourself\nunderstand the data.  \nThese visualizations can highlight outliers or unlikely combinations of variables.  \nFor example, NYC publishes data on taxi pickups and dropoffs.  \nOne might expect tips to be somewhat independent of whether someone pays cash or credit, but\nthe 75th percentile tip for cash payers is 0!  \nBecause it’s unlikely that cash payers choose not to tip, one likely explanation\nis a reporting issue in the data collection.  \nThe steps and guidelines that follow may be helpful in the research process, but refining each of your exploratory visualizations to a publishable version is not practical.\nSome of these recommendations will be specific to creating a visualization after you understand the story you’re telling.' metadata={'Header 1': 'activate plot theme', 'Header 2': 'Steps to Creating Effective Charts'}page_content='The output of this example will be a reproduction of a visualization from\n[this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/upshot/big-cities-low-skilled-workers-wages.html).  \nThis NYT article is based on research done by David Autor <sup>[1](#ely)</sup> , an\neconomist at MIT, and his co-authors.  \nAutor’s research investigates the observable changes over time between work opportunities\nin rural and urban locations in the United States.  \nThis particular graph explores how both college-educated workers and non-college-educated workers were able\nto find higher-paying jobs by working in urban areas in the 20th century.  \nMore recently, this *city wage premium* is still apparent for those\nwith college educations.

will use the [Hue Saturation Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) (HSV) paradigm as a way to formalize our discussion of colors.  \n- **Hue**: This represents the share of each of the primary colors (red, green, blue)\nas angles around a circle. The hue begins with red at 0 degrees, green at 120\ndegrees, and blue at 240 degrees (Note: matplotlib converts these back into numbers between 0 and\n1 by dividing by 360). Angles between these colors are mixes of the primary colors.\n- **Saturation**: Denotes how rich the color is using numbers between 0 and 1. At full saturation\n(saturation is 1), the color is as rich as possible. At saturation 0, the color has no\ncolor and is approximately a projection of the color into grayscale (Note that this is not\nexactly true).\n- **Value**: Denotes how dark the color is using numbers between 0 and 1. We view this as how much black\nhas been added to a color. If a color has value 0, then it is as dark as possible (the\ncolor black). If the color has value 1 then it has no black and is just the original color.  \nThe way in which HSV covers the color space is demonstrated in the following figure.  \n<img src="https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/_static/visualization_files/HSV_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png" alt="HSL_cylinder.png" style="" width="500">  \nImage attribution: By [SharkD](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9801673).  \nBelow, we demonstrate how colors change as we move hue/saturation/value one at a time.  \n```python\ndef color_swatches(colors):  \nncolors = len(colors)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(ncolors*2, 2))  \nfor (start_x, color) in enumerate(colors):\ncolor_rect = patches.Rectangle((start_x, 0), 1, 1, color=color)\nax.add_patch(color_rect)  \nax.set_xlim(0, len(colors))\nax.set_ylim(0, 1)\nax.set_yticks([])\nax.set_yticklabels([])\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_xticklabels([])  \nreturn fig\n```  \n```python' metadata={'Header 1': 'GDP quarterly growth', 'Header 2': 'Color in Plots', 'Header 3': 'Hue Saturation Lightness'}page_content='colors = [mplc.hsv_to_rgb((i/360, 1, 1)) for i in np.linspace(0, 360, 6)]\nfig = color_swatches(colors)\nfig.suptitle("Varying Hue")\n```  \n```python' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary hue'}page_content='colors = [mplc.hsv_to_rgb((0, i, 1)) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, 5)]\nfig = color_swatches(colors)\nfig.suptitle("Varying Saturation")\n```  \n```python' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary saturation'}page_content='colors = [mplc.hsv_to_rgb((0.0, 1, i)) for i in np.linspace(0, 1, 5)]\nfig = color_swatches(colors)\nfig.suptitle("Varying Value")\n```' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary value'}page_content='A good color palette will exploit aspects of hue, saturation, and value to emphasize the information\nin the data visualization.  \nFor example, for qualitatively different groups (where we just want to identify separate groups\nwhich have no quantitative relationships between them), one could fix\nthe saturation and value then draw $ N $ evenly spaced values from hue space.  \nHowever, creating a good color palette sometimes requires more nuance than can be attributed to\nrules of thumb.  \nLuckily, matplotlib and other Python packages can help us choose good color\npalettes. Often, relying on these pre-built color palettes and\nthemes is better than than creating your own.  \nWe can get a list of all of the color palettes (referred to as colormaps by matplotlib) included\nwith matplotlib by doing:  \n```python\nprint(plt.colormaps())\n```  \nThe [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html)\ndifferentiates between colormaps used for varying purposes.  \nColormaps are often split into several categories based on their function (see, e.g., [Moreland]):  \n- Sequential: incrementally change lightness and often saturation of color,\ngenerally using a single hue; should be used for representing information that has ordering.\n- Diverging: change lightness and possibly saturation of two different\ncolors that meet in the middle at an unsaturated color; should be used when the\ninformation being plotted has a critical middle value, such as topography or\nwhen the data deviates around zero.\n- Cyclic: change lightness of two different colors that meet in\nthe middle and beginning/end at an unsaturated color; should be used for\nvalues that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase angle, wind direction, or time of day.\n- Qualitative: often are miscellaneous colors; should be used to represent\ninformation which does not have ordering or relationships.  \nMost of the examples we have used so far can use qualitative colormaps because they are simply\nmeant to distinguish between different variables/observations and not say something about how they\ndiffer.  \nAdditionally, three other sources of

people do this very frequently – remember that a visualization should have ONE main message.  \nDo not pollute your message with extra information.  \nIn our example using World Bank data below, we will show that Japan’s population is aging faster\nthan that of many other economically successful countries.  \nWe show this using the age dependency ratio, which is the number of individuals aged 65+ divided by the number of individuals who are 15-64, for each country over time.  \nA high age dependency ratio means that the government will have a smaller tax base to collect from\nbut have

many lines, the message about Japan is hidden or polluted by noise.  \nIf we did want to demonstrate that Japan is significantly different than many other developed countries,\nwe might try a plot like this:  \n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  \nnot_japan = list(df.columns)\nnot_japan.remove("Japan")  \ndf[not_japan].plot(ax=ax, color=[(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)], lw=0.4, legend=False)\nax.text(1970,

on a single plot is definitely an exception, and we encourage you\nto do so sparingly.  \nGenerally, you should only have a few informative lines for each plot.  \nWe now will focus our graph on a few countries of interest.  \nTo do so, the plot below uses many different line styles.  \n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  \ndf["Japan"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, linestyle="solid")\nax.text(2002,

using line styles to distinguish between different pieces\nof data, but not many.  \nIn particular, having this many different styles and colors makes it difficult to figure out what is going on.

'No Background Colors'}page_content='Legends are quite common in charts, but many visualization experts advise against using them.  \nLegends have several weaknesses:  \n1. Relying solely on line color often makes a black and white version of your plot effectively\nuseless, since you don’t know whether the colors will be distinguishable in grayscale.\n1. Legends require people to distinguish between small samples of colors. For\nsomeone with weak eyesight or color blindness, this can make interpreting graphs nearly\nimpossible.\n1. They add distance between the data and its description. This requires peoples’ eyes to go back\nand forth between the lines and the legend when trying to understand the story being told. This\ndistracts from the ability to digest the story quickly and succinctly.  \nTo demonstrate this, we revisit our age dependency ratio example from earlier.  \n```python\ndownload_url = "https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/WorldBank_AgeDependencyRatio.csv"\ndf = pd.read_csv(download_url, na_values="..")\ndf = df[["Country Name", "1960", "1970", "1980", "1990", "2000", "2010", "2017"]]\ndf = df.set_index("Country Name").T\ndf.index = df.index.values.astype(int)\n```  \nWith a legend:  \n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  \nemph_color = (0.95, 0.05, 0.05)\nsec_color = [(0.05, 0.05+0.075*x, 0.95) for x in range(4)]\ndf["Japan"].plot(ax=ax, legend=True, color=emph_color, linewidth=2.5)\ndf["United Kingdom"].plot(ax=ax, legend=True, color=sec_color[0], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\ndf["United States"].plot(ax=ax, legend=True, color=sec_color[1], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\ndf["China"].plot(ax=ax, legend=True, color=sec_color[2], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\ndf["India"].plot(ax=ax, legend=True, color=sec_color[3], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)  \nax.spines["right"].set_visible(False)\nax.spines["top"].set_visible(False)\nax.set_title("Japan\'s Aging Population")\nax.set_ylabel("Age Dependency Ratio")\n```  \nWith labels:  \n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  \nemph_color = (0.95, 0.05, 0.05)\nsec_color = [(0.05, 0.05+0.075*x, 0.95) for x in range(4)]\ndf["Japan"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, color=emph_color, linewidth=2.5)\nax.text(2002, 35, "Japan")\ndf["United Kingdom"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, color=sec_color[0], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\nax.text(1975, 24, "UK")\ndf["United States"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, color=sec_color[1], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\nax.text(1980, 19, "US")\ndf["China"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, color=sec_color[2], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\nax.text(1990, 10, "China")\ndf["India"].plot(ax=ax, legend=False, color=sec_color[3], alpha=0.4, linewidth=0.75)\nax.text(2005, 5, "India")  \nax.spines["right"].set_visible(False)\nax.spines["top"].set_visible(False)\nax.set_title("Japan\'s Aging Population")\nax.set_ylabel("Age Dependency Ratio")\n```  \nMost people find the example with labels to be a more readable graph.' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary the values', 'Header 2': 'Visualization Rules', 'Header 3': 'Legends'}page_content='Don’t try to put too much information in a single plot!  \nWe have tried to emphasize this point throughout this lecture, but it is so important that\nwe are emphasizing it again!  \nDon’t information overload your audience!' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary the values', 'Header 2': 'Visualization Rules', 'Header 3': 'Limit the Information in a Single Plot'}page_content='Our last guideline: talk with others about your visualization.  \nThe best way to determine whether other people understand your message is to show it to them.' metadata={'Header 1': 'Vary the values', 'Header 2': 'Visualization Rules', 'Header 3': 'Talk to Other People'}page_content="<a id='ely'></a>\n**[1]** In particular, it is based on [this lecture](https://www.aeaweb.org/webcasts/2019/aea-ely-lecture-work-of-the-past-work-of-the-future)\nby Autor presented at the annual AEA meeting in January, 2019.
