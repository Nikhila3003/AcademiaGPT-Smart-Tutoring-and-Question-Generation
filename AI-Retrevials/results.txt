page_content="Stack is moving our data from wide to long and unstack is going to be moving from long to wide. Okay. So set index, reset index, stack and unstack are going to be the most fundamental reshaping operations. If you know these four or five methods, what you can do is any of the other operations that we discussed today will typically be a combination of these operations. And in fact, some of them are exactly written as combinations of these operations in the pandas code base. One little hint is, we remember stack for unstack using the following nomonic. unstack moves index levels up. Okay. So next we're going to start talking about some additional methods that again are going to be, they could be performed using the methods we've already discussed. Okay. So melt is going to be a method that moves from wide to long form. It's going to move all of the values stored in your data frame to a single column with all other columns being used to contain identifying information. Now this should sound a lot like changing data to tidy data and it is." metadata={'source': 'videos/transcripts_tiny/2.3.2 Reshaping data with pandas.srt', 'chunk_number': 14, 'timestamps': '00:18:33 --> 00:20:03'}	0.116292583389955

page_content="Hi everyone, this is Chase and the next topic that we'll be discussing is Data Re shaping. The prerequisites to understanding data reshaping are the Pandas introduction in Pandas-based lecture and the lecture that Spencer gave about Pandas indexes. After today you'll understand the idea of tidy data and you'll be able to understand and apply the melt, stack, unstack and pivot methods. We'll then practice the transformations of different indexes and we'll practice reshaping data. Our outline for today is we'll start by discussing the concept of tidy data and why you might want to consider reshaping your data for different questions or goals. We'll then discuss the idea of a long data set versus a wide data set and finally we'll begin discussing certain methods that are used for data reshaping and using include set index, reset index and transpose, stack and unstack, melt, pivot and pivot table and then we'll wrap up by using some visualizations to understand these methods a little bit more." metadata={'source': 'videos/transcripts_tiny/2.3.2 Reshaping data with pandas.srt', 'chunk_number': 0, 'timestamps': '00:00:00 --> 00:01:14'}	0.138018360438689
